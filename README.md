# Generate TV Scripts using RNNs in PyTorch
This repo contains my solution of project 4 of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree™️](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program.

It is implemented by using the PyTorch library.

**Please check out Udacity's original repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation)**

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
