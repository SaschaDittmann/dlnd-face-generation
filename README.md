# Face Generation using DCGANs

This repo contains my solution of project 5 of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree™️](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) program.

It is implemented by using the PyTorch library.

**Please check out Udacity's original repo [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation)**

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. Your goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

The project will be broken down into a series of tasks from **loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks**. At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
